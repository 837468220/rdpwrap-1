# Additional offstes for the RDP Wrapper Library by Stas'M


### Information:
This repository contains more offsets for the RDP Wrapper Library, which aren't supported natively.
As soon as a build has been added to the official repo, it will be removed here.
Just add support by adding the offsets from the text file (in this repo) corresponding to the file version "RDPConf" shows at the end of your rdpwrap.ini.
It will only contain non-Insider versions I'm able to get from the Microsoft Update Catalog or Microsoft Download Center.

Currently this repo contains additional offsets for rdpwrap.ini 2018-05-16.

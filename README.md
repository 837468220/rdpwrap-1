# Additional offstes for the RDP Wrapper Library by Stas'M


## Information:
This repository contains more offsets for the RDP Wrapper Library, which aren't supported natively.
As soon as a build has been added to the official repo, it will be removed here.

Just add support by adding the offsets from the text file (in this repo) corresponding to the file version "RDPConf" shows at the end of your rdpwrap.ini.

It will only contain non-Insider versions I'm able to get from the Microsoft Update Catalog or Microsoft Download Center.

## Version info:
Currently this repo contains additional offsets for rdpwrap.ini with last change from 2018-10-10.

Last update: 2019-02-12

Includes versions up to 2018-11-13

If you've got a version not supported by RDP Wrapper and not posted here, feel free to open an issue with file version and download link to the msu/cab-file containing the version.

Remember, that I won't determine offsets for Insider builds or preview updates. (Builds I know, which are missing are listed in the following section)

Also remember, that I won't have enough free time to immediately determine offsets. Please be patient.
